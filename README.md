## About

I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional focused on security operations, incident response, and threat analysis. This portfolio documents my hands-on experience with SOC operations, log analysis, OSINT enrichment, and blue-team security practices.

My background includes:

- **Security Operations Center (SOC) Training**: Alert triage, incident detection, and response workflow
- **Log Analysis & SIEM**: Pattern recognition, false positive elimination, and threat correlation
- **Incident Response**: Evidence collection, timeline analysis, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- **OSINT Enrichment**: Threat intelligence gathering and indicator enrichment for investigations
- **Linux & Windows Administration**: Hands-on experience with Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows environments

I approach security analytically, prioritizing clear documentation, evidence-based conclusions, and professional communication with stakeholders. This portfolio reflects my commitment to operational security and continuous learning.

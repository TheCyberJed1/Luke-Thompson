## Professional Summary
SOC-focused cybersecurity practitioner with a Purple Team mindset—able to think like an attacker while operating like a defender to improve detection, triage, and incident response outcomes. Hands-on across SIEM platforms (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel—study-based, Wazuh—homelab), EDR concepts, threat hunting methodology (MITRE ATT&CK), and security automation (Python/PowerShell) with strong documentation and operational discipline. Builds modern workflows using DevSecOps practices and Generative AI (LLMs/RAG) to accelerate alert context, enrich investigations, and standardize analyst output.

## SOC Tooling Depth (A/B/C) — Endpoint, SIEM, Network (Readiness)

### A) Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) — Microsoft Defender (concept-to-operations readiness)
- Accomplished SOC-ready endpoint investigation capability as measured by faster hypothesis formation during triage, by applying Defender-style investigation logic (alert → process tree → persistence checks → lateral movement indicators → containment decision).
- Accomplished stronger endpoint telemetry understanding as measured by more accurate scoping, by correlating common endpoint signals (process execution, auth events, network connections, file modifications) to attacker behaviors and MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

### B) SIEM & Detection Engineering — Splunk (use-case thinking)
- Accomplished improved SIEM investigation readiness as measured by repeatable triage workflows, by designing use-cases for authentication anomalies, suspicious PowerShell/process activity, lateral movement indicators, and persistence behaviors.
- Accomplished increased detection maturity as measured by clearer alert logic and prioritization, by structuring detections around threat scenarios and mapping coverage to MITRE ATT&CK.

### C) Network Traffic Analysis — Wireshark (SOC triage & evidence support)
- Accomplished improved network-level triage as measured by faster identification of suspicious traffic patterns, by analyzing PCAPs for DNS anomalies, unusual HTTP methods/headers, suspicious TLS behaviors, and beaconing-style indicators.
- Accomplished stronger evidence summaries as measured by cleaner escalation notes, by extracting key artifacts (IPs/domains/ports, session timing, protocols) and translating packet observations into SOC-friendly findings.

## Security Projects & Home Lab (Primary Experience)
Portfolio: https://thecyberjed1.github.io/Luke-Thompson

**SOC Home Lab — SIEM Monitoring, Detection, and Triage (Splunk / Sentinel / Wazuh)** | Independent
- Accomplished improved investigation speed as measured by faster time-to-context during triage, by building SIEM dashboards and search workflows that surface authentication anomalies, endpoint behaviors, and network indicators aligned to incident questions (who/what/when/where).
- Accomplished stronger detection discipline as measured by repeatable alert logic and clearer analyst actions, by creating documented use-cases with severity criteria, validation steps, and remediation guidance mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- Accomplished higher signal-to-noise as measured by fewer “junk” alerts in lab data, by iteratively tuning rules, adding enrichment, and separating informational telemetry from actionable detections.

**Threat Hunting Methodology (MITRE ATT&CK + Kill Chain)** | Independent
- Accomplished more actionable hunts as measured by validated hypotheses and converted detections, by using ATT&CK to structure hunt questions, identify required telemetry, and translate findings into new SIEM rules and runbook updates.

**Web Security Testing (OWASP Top 10 / Burp Suite Pro)** — Lab & Training Environments | Independent
- Accomplished improved vulnerability-to-remediation clarity as measured by clean retest criteria, by documenting findings with reproduction steps, business impact framing, and secure coding recommendations suitable for handoff to developers.

**Security Automation + AI (Python/PowerShell + LLM/RAG concepts)** | Independent
- Accomplished reduced analyst toil as measured by less manual enrichment and more consistent case notes, by automating parsing/enrichment steps and using structured prompts to generate first-draft triage summaries and next-action checklists (with human verification).

## Professional Experience (Transferable, Operations-Driven)

**Operations Specialist — White Glove Moving Company** | 05/2023–08/2025
- Accomplished reliable high-stakes execution as measured by low error/claim outcomes and client satisfaction, by following strict procedures, verifying completion criteria, and escalating anomalies early—directly aligned with SOC triage and incident escalation habits.
- Accomplished improved team coordination under time pressure as measured by on-time completion across complex jobs, by prioritizing tasks, communicating status clearly, and maintaining accountability through documentation.

**Customer Operations Associate — Pet Store** | 01/2022–05/2023
- Accomplished consistent service quality as measured by fast issue resolution and repeat customer trust, by triaging problems, documenting outcomes, and adhering to process in a high-volume environment involving payments and customer data.
- Accomplished reduced operational mistakes as measured by fewer rework events, by using checklists, inventory controls, and exception-handling routines comparable to runbook-driven security operations.

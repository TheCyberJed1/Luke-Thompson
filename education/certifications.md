## Certifications Philosophy

**Note on Claimed Certifications**: This portfolio clearly indicates which certifications have been earned vs. which are in progress. CompTIA A+ and Network+ represent completed self-study and knowledge acquisition, while Security+ is actively in progress with expected completion in Q1 2026.

The focus on hands-on learning (labs, incident analysis, automation) ensures that certifications represent genuine competency rather than test-passing ability alone.
